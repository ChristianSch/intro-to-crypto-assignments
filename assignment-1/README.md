# Assignment 1

(Note that programming assignments are optional.)

Write a program that allows you to "crack" ciphertexts generated using a Vigenere-like
cipher, where byte-wise XOR is used instead of addition modulo 26.

Specifically, the ciphertext `ctext.txt` was generated by encrypting English-language
text using `encrypt.c`.

(Of course, when encrypting I used a random key length and chose each byte of the key at
random.) The plaintext contains upper- and lower-case letters, punctuation, and spaces,
but no numbers.
